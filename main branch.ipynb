      "   Early reports of car in right of way before fire   Local authorities in Houston ordered evacuations and shelter- in-place orders Sept. 16 after an Energy Transfer pipeline carrying natural gas liquids caught fire.\n",
      "  The city of La Porte said its fire department responded at 9:55 am CT to the fire, which occurred in the neighboring city of Deer Park. Authorities expect the fire to continue to burn for hours,Deer Park Mayor Jerry Mouton said during a press conference Sept. 16.\n",
      "    “All of the product has to burn off,” Mouton said. First responders contained the fire, but it could burn “if not into tonight then tomorrow.”\n",
      "   Energy Transfer confirmed the fire occurred on a 20-inch line carrying Y-grade NGLs, saying that no injuries were reported. Local authorities later said one firefighter was treated for minor injuries.\n",
      "   Y-grade NGLs include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines, according to Energy Transfer product specifications and prices spiked as a result.\n",
      "   Platts propane values rose to 67.50 cents/gal, up Y on the day and the highest since Sept. 5, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n",
      "  A position for propane entered the Platts Market on Close assessment process for the first time in a week, and traded at 67.50 cents/gal, 4.75 cents/gal higher than the previous close. The price was last reported higher on Sept. 5 at 69.75 cents/gal.\n",
      "   “The line has been isolated so that the residual product in the line can safely burn itself out,” Energy Transfer spokesperson Cassidy Lamb said in a statement. “We have no timeline at this point on how long that process will take, but we are working closely with local authorities.”\n",
      "  The pipeline operator also said it was “aware of early reports indicating that an unknown passenger car entered our right of way and struck the [valve] location.”\n",
      "  Mouton acknowledged the presence of a vehicle near the burning pipeline but declined to speculate whether it caused the fire.\n",
      "  The Railroad Commission of Texas announced that its pipeline safety inspectors are also investigating the fire alongside local authorities. The regulator said the fire occurred within a pipeline corridor and that it is “notifying other pipeline operators in the corridor of the incident and getting information on measures they are taking to ensure safety of their systems.”\n",

      "  The state is also working to electrify space heating in commercial buildings and homes, which will further increase power demand. At the same time, power demand is increasing due to construction of new industrial facilities and data centers.\n",
      "  A preliminary NYISO study has found the state could be at risk of insufficient power supplies of at least 1,000 MW by 2034 due to increasing power demand as well as assumed natural gas unavailability.\n",
      "   Part of the concern is that while power demand is increasing from efforts to combat climate change and increase economic development, tighter regulations for gas-fired power plants are causing some power plants to retire, thus reducing supply while demand is increasing.\n",
      "  The NYISO study also found that there could be a New York City transmission security margin baseline deficiency starting in 2031 due to expected New York Power Authority small gas- fired power plant retirements, growing to 275 MW by 2034 due to demand growth, according to preliminary Reliability Needs Assessment results.\n",
      "  By 2034, NYISO expects 2,821 MW of incremental power generation capacity to be added to the system and 1,216 MW to be removed. Additionally, power demand from large loads during the summer peak increases from 368 MW in 2024 to 2,268 MW by 2034, with similar results for the winter peak.\n",
      "  Demand from EVs is forecast to increase from 1,124 GWh in 2024 to 36,937 GWh by 2044, according to NYISO data. Additionally, power demand from electrifying buildings is expected to outstrip power demand from EVs by around 2040.\n",

      "  From a base of 372 GW global nuclear operational capacity at the end of 2023, the report looked at high and low estimates for likely nuclear power output by 2050, depending on policy and business actions.\n",
      "   “In the high case, global nuclear operational capacity is projected to increase to 2.5 times the current capacity, reaching 950 GW by 2050,” the report said. In the low case, an increase of about 40% is predicted, taking total installed capacity to 514 GW in 2040.\n",
      "  SMRs would account for about a quarter (24%) of total installed capacity added between 2023 and 2050 in the high case. In the low case the capacity added by SMRs was 6%.\n",
      "  “SMRs have the potential to support smaller grids in developing countries, power electricity-hungry data centers, or even provide low-carbon propulsion for commercial shipping vessels,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said during the opening session of the organization’s general conference Sept. 16. “But they still have challenges to overcome before they can be deployed,” he added, noting that the IAEA is promoting regulatory\n",
      "harmonization to make SMR deployment more efficient.  The IAEA said the high case is “plausible and technically feasible, and it is possible that capacity could increase beyond that projected.”\n",
      "   However, “enabling factors” needed to reach or exceed the high case predictions include “national policies and strategies,” in for instance “supporting investment, demonstration projects for new reactor technologies, investment in grids, supply chain management for reactor construction, regulatory collaboration and global harmonization (particularly for SMR development).”\n",
      "   In North America, the low case assumed 89 GW installed capacity in 2050, or 228 GW in the high case, compared with 109.5 in 2023. For north, west and southern Europe, the 2050 low and high estimates figures are 69 GW or 135 GW, respectively. The low case represented a decline from 2023 levels of 93.8 GW.\n",

      "   Speaking at the International Atomic Energy Agency general conference in Vienna, Likhachev did not elaborate on the conditions necessary for the plant to resume generating electricity, only stressing the plant’s physical safety and security were Rosatom’s “unconditional priority.” He added that the Russian nuclear company ensures a constant thermal, water, and power supply to the facility.\n",
      "   Rosenergoatom, Rosatom’s department for Russian nuclear plant management, shut Zaporizhzhia-6, the last unit at the nuclear plant remaining in operation at that time. Rosenergoatom cited mounting security concerns as a rationale behind the decision.\n",

      "  On Oct. 6, Putin issued a decree to transfer the plant to Rosatom. Ukraine described the decree as illegal and called on Western countries to impose sanctions against Rosatom.\n",

The threats are not potential, and some of them have fully materialized, referring to “recorded damage” to the plant’s infrastructure, social facilities and “places where plant employees live,” he added.\n",
      "   Ukraine has also threatened the Kursk nuclear plant in Russia, Likhachev stated. Ukrainian forces have taken over a portion of the region in which that plant is located.\n",

      "international organizations,” he said.  The IAEA has stationed observers at Zaporizhzhia in an effort to support nuclear safety. It has called for a halt to fighting around all nuclear plants in the region, and has supported the Ukrainian nuclear regulator’s decision to order all units at Zaporizhzhia shut due to safety concerns.\n",
      "   Ukrainian authorities have blamed Russia for damage to Zaporizhzhia and surrounding transmission infrastructure.\n",
      "   Likhachev also said Rosatom was committed to fulfilling its obligations under international agreements “despite unprecedented and illegal sanction pressure.”\n",
      "   “None of our construction projects have been stopped,” Likhachev said. Rosatom commissioned Ostravets-2 in Belarus in 2023 and is proceeding with large-capacity nuclear plant projects in Bangladesh, Egypt, Hungary, Iran and Turkey, he added.\n",
